## Habits Manager App

### Idea

Currently the most apps provide you an option to track habits. On the other hand some habits are not regular. They consist of associated activities which you need to do one by one. Thus habit is not an atomic action, it's a series of related actions.

To not keep all these actions in mind it'd be nice to have an app where you can keep these repeated actions. This app should allow you:

- To add a new habit with a list of actions
- To edit this habit
- To delete a habit
- To start actions related with the habit and mark the items as finished
- After finishing the actions the current activity should be removed and you can start a new one

### Options

### Notes

- Try to improve design for app comparing to the original elements in Android Studio.
